Synchronization basics
======================

Because the Linux kernel supports symmetric multi-processing (SMP) it
must use a set of synchronization mechanisms to achieve predictable
results, free of race conditions.

.. note:: We will use the terms core, CPU and processor as
          interchangeable for the purpose of this lecture.

Race conditions can occur when the following two conditions happen
simultaneously:

.. slide:: Race conditions
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * there are at least two execution contexts that run in "parallel":

     * truly run in parallel (e.g. two system calls running on
       different processors)

     * one of the contexts can arbitrary preempt the other (e.g. an
       interrupt preempts a system call)

   * the execution contexts perform read-write accesses to shared
     memory


Race conditions can lead to erroneous results that are hard to debug,
because they manifest only when the execution contexts are scheduled
on the CPU cores in a very specific order.

A classical race condition example is an incorrect implementation for
a release operation of a resource counter:

.. slide:: Race condition: resource counter release
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. code-block:: c

      void release_resource()
      {
           counter--;

	   if (!counter)
               free_resource();
      }


A resource counter is used to keep a shared resource available until
the last user releases it but the above implementation has a race
condition that can cause freeing the resource twice:


.. slide:: Race condition scenario
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. ditaa::

                             counter is 2

        Thread A                                Thread B

           *
           |
           |
     +---------------------+
     |  dec counter        |   counter is 1

           |                 B preempts A

	                                                   v
			   			    +----------------------+
                             counter is 0           | dec counter  	   |
                                                    | if (!counter)	   |
                           resource is freed        |     free_resource(); |
			   			    | cEEE    	       	   |
			   			    +----------------------+
                        B finishes, A continues            |
           +-----------------------------------------------+
           |
           v
    +----------------------+
    | if (!counter)	   |
    |     free_resource(); | resource is freed
    | cEEE     	       	   |
    +----------------------+

In most cases the `release_resource()` function will only free the
resource once. However, in the scenario above, if thread A is
preempted right after decrementing `counter` and thread B calls
`release_resource()` it will cause the resource to be freed. When
resumed, thread A will also free the resource since the counter value
is 0.

To avoid race conditions the programmer must first identify the
critical section that can generate a race condition. The critical
section is the part of the code that reads and writes shared memory
from multiple parallel contexts.

In the example above, the minimal critical section is starting with
the counter decrement and ending with checking the counter's value.

Once the critical section has been identified race conditions can be
avoided by using one of the following approaches:

.. slide:: Avoiding race conditions
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * make the critical section **atomic** (e.g. use atomic
     instructions)

   * **disable preemption** during the critical section (e.g. disable
     interrupts, bottom-half handlers, or thread preemption)

   * **serialize the access** to the critical section (e.g. use spin
     locks or mutexes to allow only one context or thread in the
     critical section)



Linux kernel concurrency sources
================================

There are multiple source of concurrency in the Linux kernel that
depend on the kernel configuration as well as the type of system it
runs on:


.. slide:: Linux kernel concurrency sources
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * **single core systems**, **non-preemptive kernel**: the current
     process can be preempted by interrupts

   * **single core systems**, **preemptive kernel**: above + the
     current process can be preempted by other processes

   * **multi-core systems**: above + the current process can run
     in parallel with another process or with an interrupt running on
     another processor

.. note:: We only discuss kernel concurrency and that is why a
	  non-preemptive kernel running on an single core system
	  has interrupts as the only source of concurrency.


Atomic operations
=================

In certain circumstances we can avoid race conditions by using atomic
operations that are provided by hardware. Linux provides a unified API
to access atomic operations:

.. slide:: Atomic operations
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * integer based:

     * simple: :c:func:`atomic_inc`, :c:func:`atomic_dec`,
       :c:func:`atomic_add`, :c:func:`atomic_sub`

     * conditional: :c:func:`atomic_dec_and_test`, :c:func:`atomic_sub_and_test`

   * bit based:

     * simple: :c:func:`test_bit`, :c:func:`set_bit`,
       :c:func:`change_bit`

     * conditional: :c:func:`test_and_set_bit`, :c:func:`test_and_clear_bit`,
       :c:func:`test_and_change_bit`

For example, we could use :c:func:`atomic_dec_and_test` to implement
the resource counter decrement and value checking atomic:

.. slide:: Using :c:func:`atomic_dec_and_test` to implement resource counter release
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. code-block:: c

      void release_resource()
      {
          if (atomic_dec_and_test(&counter))
               free_resource();
      }


One complication with atomic operations is encountered in
multi-core systems, where an atomic operation is not longer
atomic at the system level (but still atomic at the core level).

To understand why, we need to decompose the atomic operation in memory
loads and stores. Then we can construct race condition scenarios where
the load and store operations are interleaved across CPUs, like in the
example below where incrementing a value from two processors will
produce an unexpected result:

.. slide:: Atomic operations may not be atomic on SMP systems
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

In order to provide atomic operations on SMP systems different
architectures use different techniques. For example, on x86 a LOCK
prefix is used to lock the system bus while executing the prefixed
operation:

   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   |_|

                                   |   v <- 2   |   STORE (2)   |             |
                                   |            |-------------->|             |

                                   +------------+               +-------------+


On ARM the LDREX and STREX instructions are used together to guarantee
atomic access: LDREX loads a value and signals the exclusive monitor
that an atomic operation is in progress. The STREX attempts to store a
new value but only succeeds if the exclusive monitor has not detected
other exclusive operations. So, to implement atomic operations the
programmer must retry the operation (both LDREX and STREX) until the
exclusive monitor signals a success.

Although they are often interpreted as "light" or "efficient"
synchronization mechanisms (because they "don't require spinning or
context switches", or because they "are implemented in hardware so
they must be more efficient", or because they "are just instructions
so they must have similar efficiency as other instructions"), as seen
from the implementation details, atomic operations are actually
expensive.


Disabling preemption (interrupts)
=================================

On single core systems and non preemptive kernels the only source of
concurrency is the preemption of the current thread by an
interrupt. To prevent concurrency is thus sufficient to disable
interrupts.

This is done with architecture specific instructions, but Linux offers
architecture independent APIs to disable and enable interrupts:

.. slide:: Synchronization with interrupts (x86)
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. code-block:: c

       #define local_irq_disable() \
           asm volatile („cli” : : : „memory”)

      #define local_irq_enable() \
          asm volatile („sti” : : : „memory”)

      #define local_irq_save(flags) \
          asm volatile ("pushf ; pop %0" :"=g" (flags)
                        : /* no input */: "memory") \
          asm volatile("cli": : :"memory")

      #define local_irq_restore(flags) \
          asm volatile ("push %0 ; popf"
                        : /* no output */
                        : "g" (flags) :"memory", "cc");


Although the interrupts can be explicitly disabled and enable with
:c:func:`local_irq_disable` and :c:func:`local_irq_enable` these APIs
should only be used when the current state and interrupts is
known. They are usually used in core kernel code (like interrupt
handling).

For typical cases where we want to avoid interrupts due to concurrency
issues it is recommended to use the :c:func:`local_irq_save` and
:c:func:`local_irq_restore` variants. They take care of saving and
restoring the interrupts states so they can be freely called from
overlapping critical sections without the risk of accidentally
enabling interrupts while still in a critical section, as long as the
calls are balanced.

Spin Locks
==========

Spin locks are used to serialize access to a critical section. They
are necessary on multi-core systems where we can have true execution
parallelism. This is a typical spin lock implementation:


.. slide:: Spin Lock Implementation Example (x86)
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. code-block:: asm

      spin_lock:
          lock bts [my_lock], 0
	  jc spin_lock

      /* critical section */

      spin_unlock:
          mov [my_lock], 0

   **bts dts, src** - bit test and set; it copies the src bit from the dts
   memory address to the carry flag and then sets it:

   .. code-block:: c

      CF <- dts[src]
      dts[src] <- 1


As it can be seen, the spin lock uses an atomic instruction to make
sure that only one core can enter the critical section. If there are
multiple cores trying to enter they will continuously "spin" until the
lock is released.

While the spin lock avoids race conditions, it can have a significant
impact on the system's performance due to "lock contention":


.. slide:: Lock Contention
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * There is lock contention when at least one core spins trying to
     enter the critical section lock

   * Lock contention grows with the critical section size, time spent
     in the critical section and the number of cores in the system


Another negative side effect of spin locks is cache thrashing.

.. slide:: Cache Thrashing
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   Cache thrashing occurs when multiple cores are trying to read and
   write to the same memory resulting in excessive cache misses.

   Since spin locks continuously access memory during lock contention,
   cache thrashing is a common occurrence due to the way cache
   coherency is implemented.


Cache coherency in multi-processor systems
==========================================

The memory hierarchy in multi-processor systems is composed of local
CPU caches (L1 caches), shared CPU caches (L2 caches) and the main
memory. To explain cache coherency we will ignore the L2 cache and
only consider the L1 caches and main memory.

In the figure below we present a view of the memory hierarchy with two
variables A and B that fall into different cache lines and where
caches and the main memory are synchronized:

.. slide:: Synchronized caches and memory
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   |_|

   .. ditaa::

        +-------+             +-------+
        | CPU 0 |             | CPU 1 |
        +-------+             +-------+
          cache                 cache
        +-------+             +-------+
      A |   1   |             |   1   | A
        +-------+             +-------+
      B |   2   |             |   2   | B
        +-------+             +-------+
                     memory
        +-----------------------------+
      A |              1              |
        +-----------------------------+
      B |              2              |
        +-----------------------------+


In the absence of a synchronization mechanism between the caches and
main memory, when CPU 0 executes `A = A + B` and CPU 1 executes `B =
A + B` we will have the following memory view:

.. slide:: Unsynchronized caches and memory
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   |_|

   .. ditaa::

        +-------+             +-------+
        | CPU 0 |             | CPU 1 |
        +-------+             +-------+
        A <- A + B            B <- A + B

        +-------+             +-------+
      A |   3   |             |   1   | A
        +-------+             +-------+
      B |   2   |             |   3   | B
        +-------+             +-------+
	       write back caches
        +-----------------------------+
      A |              1              |
        +-----------------------------+
      B |              2              |
        +-----------------------------+


In order to avoid the situation above multi-processor systems use
cache coherency protocols. There are two main types of cache coherency
protocols:

.. slide:: Cache Coherency Protocols
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Bus snooping (sniffing) based: memory bus transactions are
     monitored by caches and they take actions to preserve
     coherency

   * Directory based: there is a separate entity (directory) that
     maintains the state of caches; caches interact with directory
     to preserve coherency

   Bus snooping is simpler but it performs poorly when the number of
   cores goes beyond 32-64.

   Directory based cache coherence protocols scale much better (up
   to thousands of cores) and are usually used in NUMA systems.


A simple cache coherency protocol that is commonly used in practice is
MESI (named after the acronym of the cache line states names:
**Modified**, **Exclusive**, **Shared** and **Invalid**). It's main
characteristics are:

.. slide:: MESI Cache Coherence Protocol
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Caching policy: write back

   * Cache line states

     * Modified: owned by a single core and dirty

     * Exclusive: owned by a single core and clean

     * Shared: shared between multiple cores and clean

     * Invalid : the line is not cached

Issuing read or write requests from CPU cores will trigger state
transitions, as exemplified below:

.. slide:: MESI State Transitions
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * Invalid -> Exclusive: read request, all other cores have the line
     in Invalid; line loaded from memory

   * Invalid -> Shared: read request, at least one core has the line
     in Shared or Exclusive; line loaded from sibling cache

   * Invalid/Shared/Exclusive -> Modified: write request; **all
     other** cores **invalidate** the line

   * Modified -> Invalid: write request from other core; line is
     flushed to memory


.. note:: The most important characteristic of the MESI protocol is
          that it is a write-invalidate cache protocol. When writing to a
	  shared location all other caches are invalidated.

This has important performance impact in certain access patterns, and
one such pattern is contention for a simple spin lock implementation
like we discussed above.

To exemplify this issue lets consider a system with three CPU cores,
where the first has acquired the spin lock and it is running the
critical section while the other two are spinning waiting to enter the
critical section:

.. slide:: Cache thrashing due to spin lock contention

          |                              |                         |
          |                              |                         |
          |                              |                         |

                                         v

                                    cache miss

As it can be seen from the figure above due to the writes issued by
the cores spinning on the lock we see frequent cache line invalidate
operations which means that basically the two waiting cores will flush
and load the cache line while waiting for the lock, creating
unnecessary traffic on the memory bus and slowing down memory accesses
for the first core.

Another issue is that most likely data accessed by the first CPU
during the critical section is stored in the same cache line with the
lock (common optimization to have the data ready in the cache after
the lock is acquired). Which means that the cache invalidation
triggered by the two other spinning cores will slow down the execution
of the critical section which in turn triggers more cache invalidate
actions.

Optimized spin locks
====================

As we have seen simple spin lock implementations can have poor
performance issues due to cache thrashing, especially as the number of
cores increase. To avoid this issue there are two possible strategies:

* reduce the number of writes and thus reduce the number of cache
  invalidate operations

* avoid the other processors spinning on the same cache line, and thus
  avoid the cache invalidate operations


An optimized spin lock implementation that uses the first approach is
presented below:

.. slide:: Optimized spin lock (KeAcquireSpinLock)
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   |_|

   .. code-block:: asm

      spin_lock:
          rep ; nop
          test lock_addr, 1
          jnz spin_lock
          lock bts lock_addr
          jc spin_lock


   * we first test the lock read only, using a non atomic
     instructions, to avoid writes and thus invalidate operations
     while we spin

   * only when the lock *might* be free, we try to acquire it

The implementation also use the **PAUSE** instruction to avoid
pipeline flushes due to (false positive) memory order violations and
to add a small delay (proportional with the memory bus frequency) to
reduce power consumption.

A similar implementation with support for fairness (the CPU cores are
allowed in the critical section based on the time of arrival) is used
in the Linux kernel (the `ticket spin lock <https://lwn.net/Articles/267968/>`_)
for many architectures.

However, for the x86 architecture, the current spin lock
implementation uses a queued spin lock where the CPU cores spin on
different locks (hopefully distributed in different cache lines) to
avoid cache invalidation operations:

.. slide:: Queued Spin Locks
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   |_|

   .. ditaa::

           +-------------------------------------------+
           |              Queued Spin Lock        cEEE |
           |                                           |
           |   +---+      +---+      +---+      +---+  |

           |   +---+      +---+      +---+      +---+  |
           |     ^          ^          ^          ^    |
           |     |          |          |          |    |
           +-------------------------------------------+
                 |          |	       |          |
               CPU10      CPU17       CPU99     CPU0
              owns the   spins on    spins on  spins on
               lock      private     private   private
                          lock        lock      lock



Conceptually, when a new CPU core tries to acquire the lock and it
fails it will add its private lock to the list of waiting CPU
cores. When the lock owner exits the critical section it unlocks the
next lock in the list, if any.

While a read spin optimized spin lock reduces most of the cache
invalidation operations, the lock owner can still generate cache
invalidate operations due to writes to data structures close to the
lock and thus part of the same cache line. This in turn generates
memory traffic on subsequent reads on the spinning cores.

Hence, queued spin locks scale much better for large number of cores
as is the case for NUMA systems. And since they have similar fairness
properties as the ticket lock it is the preferred implementation on
the x86 architecture.


Process and Interrupt Context Synchronization
=============================================

Accessing shared data from both process and interrupt context is a
relatively common scenario. On single core systems we can do this by
disabling interrupts, but that won't work on multi-core systems,
as we can have the process running on one CPU core and the interrupt
context running on a different CPU core.

Using a spin lock, which was designed for multi-processor systems,
seems like the right solution, but doing so can cause common
deadlock conditions, as detailed by the following scenario:


.. slide:: Process and Interrupt Handler Synchronization Deadlock
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * In the process context we take the spin lock

   * An interrupt occurs and it is scheduled on the same CPU core

   * The interrupt handler runs and tries to take the spin lock

   * The current CPU will deadlock


To avoid this issue a two fold approach is used:


.. slide:: Interrupt Synchronization for SMP
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * In process context: disable interrupts and acquire a spin lock;
     this will protect both against interrupt or other CPU cores race
     conditions (:c:func:`spin_lock_irqsave` and
     :c:func:`spin_lock_restore` combine the two operations)

   * In interrupt context: take a spin lock; this will will protect
     against race conditions with other interrupt handlers or process
     context running on different processors


We have the same issue for other interrupt context handlers such as
softirqs, tasklets or timers and while disabling interrupts might
work, it is recommended to use dedicated APIs:

.. slide:: Bottom-Half Synchronization for SMP
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * In process context use :c:func:`spin_lock_bh` (which combines
     :c:func:`local_bh_disable` and :c:func:`spin_lock`) and
     :c:func:`spin_unlock_bh` (which combines :c:func:`spin_unlock` and
     :c:func:`local_bh_enable`)

   * In bottom half context use: :c:func:`spin_lock` and
     :c:func:`spin_unlock` (or :c:func:`spin_lock_irqsave` and
     :c:func:`spin_lock_irqrestore` if sharing data with interrupt
     handlers)


As mentioned before, another source of concurrency in the Linux kernel
can be other processes, due to preemption.

.. slide:: Preemption
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   |_|

   Preemption is configurable: when active it provides better latency
   and response time, while when deactivated it provides better
   throughput.

   Preemption is disabled by spin locks and mutexes but it can be
   manually disabled as well (by core kernel code).


As for local interrupt enabling and disabling APIs, the bottom half
and preemption APIs allows them to be used in overlapping critical
sections. A counter is used to track the state of bottom half and
preemption. In fact the same counter is used, with different increment
values:

.. slide:: Preemption and Bottom-Half Masking
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. code-block:: c

      #define PREEMPT_BITS      8
      #define SOFTIRQ_BITS      8
      #define HARDIRQ_BITS      4
      #define NMI_BITS          1

      #define preempt_disable() preempt_count_inc()

      #define local_bh_disable() add_preempt_count(SOFTIRQ_OFFSET)

      #define local_bh_enable() sub_preempt_count(SOFTIRQ_OFFSET)

      #define irq_count() (preempt_count() & (HARDIRQ_MASK | SOFTIRQ_MASK))

      #define in_interrupt() irq_count()

      asmlinkage void do_softirq(void)
      {
          if (in_interrupt()) return;
          ...


Mutexes
=======

Mutexes are used to protect against race conditions from other CPU
cores but they can only be used in **process context**. As opposed to
spin locks, while a thread is waiting to enter the critical section it
will not use CPU time, but instead it will be added to a waiting queue
until the critical section is vacated.

Since mutexes and spin locks usage intersect, it is useful to compare
the two:

.. slide:: Mutexes
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * They don't "waste" CPU cycles; system throughput is better than
     spin locks if context switch overhead is lower than medium
     spinning time

   * They can't be used in interrupt context

   * They have a higher latency than spin locks

Conceptually, the :c:func:`mutex_lock` operation is relatively simple:
if the mutex is not acquired we an take the fast path via an atomic
exchange operation:


.. slide:: :c:func:`mutex_lock` fast path
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. code-block:: c

      void __sched mutex_lock(struct mutex *lock)
      {
        might_sleep();

        if (!__mutex_trylock_fast(lock))
          __mutex_lock_slowpath(lock);
      }

      static __always_inline bool __mutex_trylock_fast(struct mutex *lock)
      {
        unsigned long curr = (unsigned long)current;

        if (!atomic_long_cmpxchg_acquire(&lock->owner, 0UL, curr))
          return true;

        return false;
      }


otherwise we take the slow path where we add ourselves to the mutex
waiting list and put ourselves to sleep:

.. slide:: :c:func:`mutex_lock` slow path
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. code-block:: c

      ...
        spin_lock(&lock->wait_lock);
      ...
        /* add waiting tasks to the end of the waitqueue (FIFO): */
        list_add_tail(&waiter.list, &lock->wait_list);
      ...
        waiter.task = current;
      ...
        for (;;) {
	  if (__mutex_trylock(lock))
	    goto acquired;
        ...
	  spin_unlock(&lock->wait_lock);
	...
          set_current_state(state);
      	  spin_lock(&lock->wait_lock);
        }
        spin_lock(&lock->wait_lock);
      acquired:
        __set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
        mutex_remove_waiter(lock, &waiter, current);
        spin_lock(&lock->wait_lock);
      ...

The full implementation is a bit more complex: instead of going to
sleep immediately it optimistic spinning if it detects that the lock
owner is currently running on a different CPU as chances are the owner
will release the lock soon. It also checks for signals and handles
mutex debugging for locking dependency engine debug feature.


The :c:func:`mutex_unlock` operation is symmetric: if there are no
waiters on the mutex then we an take the fast path via an atomic exchange
operation:

.. slide:: :c:func:`mutex_unlock` fast path
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. code-block:: c

      void __sched mutex_unlock(struct mutex *lock)
      {
	if (__mutex_unlock_fast(lock))
	  return;
	__mutex_unlock_slowpath(lock, _RET_IP_);
      }

      static __always_inline bool __mutex_unlock_fast(struct mutex *lock)
      {
	unsigned long curr = (unsigned long)current;

	if (atomic_long_cmpxchg_release(&lock->owner, curr, 0UL) == curr)
	  return true;

	return false;
      }

      void __mutex_lock_slowpath(struct mutex *lock)
      {
      ...
        if (__mutex_waiter_is_first(lock, &waiter))
		__mutex_set_flag(lock, MUTEX_FLAG_WAITERS);
      ...


.. note:: Because :c:type:`struct task_struct` is cached aligned the 7
          lower bits of the owner field can be used for various flags,
          such as :c:type:`MUTEX_FLAG_WAITERS`.


Otherwise we take the slow path where we pick up first waiter from the
list and wake it up:

.. slide:: :c:func:`mutex_unlock` slow path
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. code-block:: c

      ...
      spin_lock(&lock->wait_lock);
      if (!list_empty(&lock->wait_list)) {
        /* get the first entry from the wait-list: */
        struct mutex_waiter *waiter;
        waiter = list_first_entry(&lock->wait_list, struct mutex_waiter,
                                  list);
	next = waiter->task;
	wake_q_add(&wake_q, next);
      }
      ...
      spin_unlock(&lock->wait_lock);
      ...
      wake_up_q(&wake_q);



Per CPU data
============

Per CPU data avoids race conditions by avoiding to use shared
data. Instead, an array sized to the maximum possible CPU cores is
used and each core will use its own array entry to read and write
data. This approach certainly has advantages:


.. slide:: Per CPU data
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * No need to synchronize to access the data

   * No contention, no performance impact

   * Well suited for distributed processing where aggregation is only
     seldom necessary (e.g. statistics counters)


Memory Ordering and Barriers
============================

Modern processors and compilers employ out-of-order execution to
improve performance. For example, processors can execute "future"
instructions while waiting for current instruction data to be fetched
from memory.

Here is an example of out of order compiler generated code:

.. slide:: Out of Order Compiler Generated Code
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   +-------------------+-------------------------+
   | C code            | Compiler generated code |
   +-------------------+-------------------------+
   |.. code-block:: c  |.. code-block:: asm      |
   |		       |			 |
   |   a = 1;          |  MOV R10, 1		 |
   |   b = 2;          |  MOV R11, 2		 |
   |                   |  STORE R11, b		 |
   |                   |  STORE R10, a		 |
   +-------------------+-------------------------+


.. note:: When executing instructions out of order the processor makes
          sure that data dependency is observed, i.e. it won't execute
          instructions whose input depend on the output of a previous
          instruction that has not been executed.

In most cases out of order execution is not an issue. However, in
certain situations (e.g. communicating via shared memory between
processors or between processors and hardware) we must issue some
instructions before others even without data dependency between them.

For this purpose we can use barriers to order memory operations:

.. slide:: Barriers
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * A read barrier (:c:func:`rmb()`, :c:func:`smp_rmb()`) is used to
     make sure that no read operation crosses the barrier; that is,
     all read operation before the barrier are complete before
     executing the first instruction after the barrier

   * A write barrier (:c:func:`wmb()`, :c:func:`smp_wmb()`) is used to
     make sure that no write operation crosses the barrier

   * A simple barrier (:c:func:`mb()`, :c:func:`smp_mb()`) is used
     to make sure that no write or read operation crosses the barrier


Read Copy Update (RCU)
======================

Read Copy Update is a special synchronization mechanism similar with
read-write locks but with significant improvements over it (and some
limitations):

.. slide:: Read Copy Update (RCU)
   :level: 2
   :inline-contents: True

   * **Read-only** lock-less access at the same time with write access

   * Write accesses still requires locks in order to avoid races
     between writers

   * Requires unidirectional traversal by readers


In fact, the read-write locks in the Linux kernel have been deprecated
and then removed, in favor of RCU.

Implementing RCU for a new data structure is difficult, but a few
common data structures (lists, queues, trees) do have RCU APIs that
can be used.

RCU splits removal updates to the data structures in two phases:

.. slide:: Removal and Reclamation
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * **Removal**: removes references to elements. Some old readers may
     still see the old reference so we can't free the element.

   * **Elimination**: free the element. This action is postponed until
     all existing readers finish traversal (quiescent cycle). New
     readers won't affect the quiescent cycle.


As an example, lets take a look on how to delete an element from a
list using RCU:

.. slide:: RCU List Delete
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   |_|

   .. ditaa::

         (1) List Traversal                          (2) Removal
                                                    +-----------+
      +-----+     +-----+     +-----+      +-----+  |  +-----+  |  +-----+
      |     |     |     |     |     |      |     |  |  |     |  |  |     |
      |  A  |---->|  B  |---->|  C  |      |  A  |--+  |  B  |--+->|  C  |
      |     |     |     |     |     |      |     |     |     |     |     |
      +-----+     +-----+     +-----+      +-----+     +-----+     +-----+
         ^           ^           ^            ^           ^           ^
         |           |           |            |           |           |







         (3) Quiescent cycle over                 (4) Reclamation
               +-----------+
      +-----+  |  +-----+  |  +-----+      +-----+                 +-----+
      |     |  |  |     |  |  |     |      |     |                 |     |
      |  A  |--+  |  B  |  +->|  C  |      |  A  |---------------->|  C  |
      |     |     |     |     |     |      |     |                 |     |
      +-----+     +-----+     +-----+      +-----+                 +-----+
         ^                       ^            ^                       ^
         |                       |            |                       |


In the first step it can be seen that while readers traverse the list
all elements are referenced. In step two a writer removes
element B. Reclamation is postponed since there are still readers that
hold references to it. In step three a quiescent cycle just expired
and it can be noticed that there are no more references to
element B. Other elements still have references from readers that
started the list traversal after the element was removed. In step 4 we
finally perform reclamation (free the element).


Now that we covered how RCU functions at the high level, lets looks at
the APIs for traversing the list as well as adding and removing an
element to the list:


.. slide:: RCU list APIs cheat sheet
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   .. code-block:: c

      /* list traversal */
      rcu_read_lock();
      list_for_each_entry_rcu(i, head) {
        /* no sleeping, blocking calls or context switch allowed */
      }
      rcu_read_unlock();


      /* list element delete  */
      spin_lock(&lock);
      list_del_rcu(&node->list);
      spin_unlock(&lock);
      synchronize_rcu();
      kfree(node);

      /* list element add  */
      spin_lock(&lock);
      list_add_rcu(head, &node->list);
      spin_unlock(&lock);
