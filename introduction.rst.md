### Source code navigation

#### cscope

`Cscope <http://cscope.sourceforge.net/>`__ is a tool for efficient navigation of C sources.
To use it, a cscope database must be generated from the existing sources.
In a Linux tree, the command :command:`make ARCH=x86 cscope` is sufficient.
Specification of the architecture through the ARCH variable is optional but recommended;
otherwise, some architecture dependent functions will appear multiple times in the database.

You can build the cscope database with the command ``make ARCH=x86 COMPILED_SOURCE=1 cscope``.
This way, the cscope database will only contain symbols that have already been used in the compile process before, thus resulting in better performance when searching for symbols.

Cscope can also be used as stand-alone, but it is more useful when combined with an editor.
To use cscope with ``vim``, it is necessary to install both packages and add the following lines to the file ``.vimrc`` (the machine in the lab already has the settings):

```vim

    if has("cscope")
            " Look for a 'cscope.out' file starting from the current directory,
            " going up to the root directory.
            let s:dirs = split(getcwd(), "/")
            while s:dirs != []
                    let s:path = "/" . join(s:dirs, "/")
                    if (filereadable(s:path . "/cscope.out"))
                            execute "cs add " . s:path . "/cscope.out " . s:path . " -v"
                            break
                    endif
                    let s:dirs = s:dirs[:-2]
            endwhile

            set csto=0  " Use cscope first, then ctags
            set cst     " Only search cscope
            set csverb  " Make cs verbose

            nmap `<C-\>`s :cs find s `<C-R>`=expand("`<cword>`")`<CR>``<CR>`
            nmap `<C-\>`g :cs find g `<C-R>`=expand("`<cword>`")`<CR>``<CR>`
            nmap `<C-\>`c :cs find c `<C-R>`=expand("`<cword>`")`<CR>``<CR>`
            nmap `<C-\>`t :cs find t `<C-R>`=expand("`<cword>`")`<CR>``<CR>`
            nmap `<C-\>`e :cs find e `<C-R>`=expand("`<cword>`")`<CR>``<CR>`
            nmap `<C-\>`f :cs find f `<C-R>`=expand("`<cfile>`")`<CR>``<CR>`
            nmap `<C-\>`i :cs find i ^`<C-R>`=expand("`<cfile>`")`<CR>`$`<CR>`
            nmap `<C-\>`d :cs find d `<C-R>`=expand("`<cword>`")`<CR>``<CR>`
            nmap <F6> :cnext <CR>
            nmap <F5> :cprev <CR>

            " Open a quickfix window for the following queries.
            set cscopequickfix=s-,c-,d-,i-,t-,e-,g-
    endif
```

The script searches for a file called ``cscope.out`` in the current directory, or in parent directories.
If ``vim`` finds this file, you can use the shortcut ``Ctrl +]`` or ``Ctrl+\ g`` (the combination control-\\ followed by g) to jump directly to the definition of the word under the cursor (function, variable, structure, etc.).
Similarly, you can use ``Ctrl+\ s`` to go where the word under the cursor is used.

You can take a cscope-enabled ``.vimrc`` file (also contains other goodies) from https://github.com/ddvlad/cfg/blob/master/\_vimrc.
The following guidelines are based on this file, but also show basic ``vim`` commands that have the same effect.

If there are more than one results (usually there are) you can move between them using ``F6`` and ``F5`` (``:ccnext`` and ``:cprev``).
You can also open a new panel showing the results using ``:copen``.
To close the panel, use the ``:cclose`` command.

To return to the previous location, use ``Ctrl+o`` (o, not zero).
The command can be used multiple times and works even if cscope changed the file you are currently editing.

To go to a symbol definition directly when ``vim`` starts, use ``vim -t <symbol_name>`` (for example ``vim -t task_struct``).
Otherwise, if you started ``vim`` and want to search for a symbol by name, use ``cs find g <symbol_name>`` (for example ``cs find g task_struct``).

If you found more than one results and opened a panel showing all the matches (using ``:copen``) and you want to find a symbol of type structure, it is recommended to search in the results panel (using ``/`` -- slash) the character ``{`` (opening brace).

---

##### Important

You can get a summary of all the ``cscope`` commands using ``:cs help``.

For more info, use the ``vim`` built-in help ``:h cscope`` or ``:h copen``.

---

If you use :command:`emacs`, install the :code:`xcscope-el` package and
add the following lines in :file:`~/.emacs`.

.. code-block:: vim

    (require ‘xcscope)
    (cscope-setup)

These commands will activate cscope for the C and C++ modes automatically.
:code:`C-s s` is the key bindings prefix and :code:`C-s s s` is used to
search for a symbol (if you call it when the cursor is over a word,
it will use that). For more details, check `https://github.com/dkogan/xcscope.el`

#### Kscope

For a simpler interface, `Kscope <http://sourceforge.net/projects/kscope/>`__
is a cscope frontend which uses QT. It is lightweight, very fast and very
easy to use. It allows searching using regular expressions, call graphs, etc.
Kscope is no longer mantained.

There is also a `port <https///opendesktop.org/content/show.php/Kscope4?content=156987>`__
of version 1.6 for Qt4 and KDE 4 which keeps the integration of the text
editor Kate and is easier to use than the last version on SourceForge.

#### LXR Cross-Reference

LXR (LXR Cross-Reference) is a tool that allows indexing and
referencing the symbols in the source code of a program using
a web interface. The web interface shows links to
locations in files where a symbol is defined or used. Development website
for LXR is http://sourceforge.net/projects/lxr. Similar tools
are `OpenGrok <http://oracle.github.io/opengrok/>`__ and
`Gonzui <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzui>`__.

Although LXR was originally intended for the Linux kernel sources, it is
also used in the sources of `Mozilla <http://lxr.mozilla.org/>`__,
`Apache HTTP Server <http://apache.wirebrain.de/lxr/>`__ and
`FreeBSD <http://lxr.linux.no/freebsd/source>`__.

There are a number of sites that use LXR for cross-referencing the
the sources of the Linux kernel, the main site being `the original site of
development <http://lxr.linux.no/linux/>`__ which does not work anymore. You can
use `https://elixir.bootlin.com/ <https://elixir.bootlin.com/>`__.

LXR allows searching for an identifier (symbol), after a free text
or after a file name. The main feature and, at the same
time, the main advantage provided is the ease of finding the declaration
of any global identifier. This way, it facilitates quick access to function
declarations, variables, macro definitions and the code can be easily
navigated. Also, the fact that it can detect what code areas are affected
when a variable or function is changed is a real advantage in the development
and debugging phase.

#### SourceWeb

`SourceWeb <http://rprichard.github.io/sourceweb/>`__ is a source code indexer
for C and C++. It uses the
`framework <http://clang.llvm.org/docs/IntroductionToTheClangAST.html>`__
provided by the Clang compiler to index the code.

The main difference between cscope and SourceWeb is the fact that SourceWeb
is, in a way, a compiler pass. SourceWeb doesn't index all the code, but
only the code that was efectively compiled by the compiler. This way, some
problems are eliminated, such as ambiguities about which variant of a function
defined in multiple places is used. This also means that the indexing takes
more time, because the compiled files must pass one more time through
the indexer to generate the references.

Usage example:

.. code-block:: bash

    make oldconfig
    sw-btrace make -j4
    sw-btrace-to-compile-db
    sw-clang-indexer --index-project
    sourceweb index

:file:`sw-btrace` is a script that adds the :file:`libsw-btrace.so`
library to :code:`LD_PRELOAD`. This way, the library is loaded by
every process started by :code:`make` (basically, the compiler),
registers the commands used to start the processes and generates
a filed called :file:`btrace.log`. This file is then used by
:code:`sw-btrace-to-compile-db` which converts it to a format defined
by clang: `JSON Compilation Database <http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html>`__.
This JSON Compilation Database resulted from the above steps is then
used by the indexer, which makes one more pass through the compiled
source files and generates the index used by the GUI.

Word of advice: don't index the sources you are working with, but use
a copy, because SourceWeb doesn't have, at this moment, the capability
to regenerate the index for a single file and you will have to regenerate
the complete index.

### Debugging

Debugging a kernel is a much more difficult process than the debugging
of a program, because there is no support from the operating system.
This is why this process is usually done using two computers, connected
on serial interfaces.

.. _gdb_intro:

#### gdb (Linux)

A simpler debug method on Linux, but with many disadvantages,
is local debugging, using `gdb <http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/>`__,
the uncompressed kernel image (:file:`vmlinux`) and :file:`/proc/kcore`
(the real-time kernel image). This method is usually used to inspect
the kernel and detect certain inconsistencies while it runs. The
method is useful especially if the kernel was compiled using the
:code:`-g` option, which keeps debug information. Some well-known
debug techniques can't be used by this method, such as breakpoints
of data modification.

.. note:: Because :file:`/proc` is a virtual filesystem, :file:`/proc/kcore`
          does not physically exist on the disk. It is generated on-the-fly
          by the kernel when a program tries to access :file:`proc/kcore`.

          It is used for debugging purposes.

          From :command:`man proc`, we have:

          ::

              /proc/kcore
              This file represents the physical memory of the system and is stored in the ELF core file format.  With this pseudo-file, and
              an unstripped kernel (/usr/src/linux/vmlinux) binary, GDB can be used to examine the current state of any kernel data struc‐
              tures.

The uncompressed kernel image offers information about the data structures
and symbols it contains.

.. code-block:: bash

    student@eg106$ cd ~/src/linux
    student@eg106$ file vmlinux
    vmlinux: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, ...
    student@eg106$ nm vmlinux | grep sys_call_table
    c02e535c R sys_call_table
    student@eg106$ cat System.map | grep sys_call_table
    c02e535c R sys_call_table

The :command:`nm` utility is used to show the symbols in an object or
executable file. In our case, :file:`vmlinux` is an ELF file. Alternately,
we can use the file :file:`System.map` to view information about the
symbols in kernel.

Then we use :command:`gdb` to inspect the symbols using the uncompressed
kernel image. A simple :command:`gdb` session is the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    student@eg106$ cd ~/src/linux
    stduent@eg106$ gdb --quiet vmlinux
    Using host libthread_db library "/lib/tls/libthread_db.so.1".

    0xc01013d7 `<sys_fork+4>`:        mov    $0x11,%eax
    0xc01013dc `<sys_fork+9>`:        push   $0x0

    0xc01013ee `<sys_fork+27>`:       ret
    End of assembler dump.

It can be noticed that the uncompressed kernel image was used as an argument
for :command:`gdb`. The image can be found in the root of the kernel sources
after compilation.

A few commands used for debugging using :command:`gdb` are:

- :command:`x` (examine) - Used to show the contents of the memory area
  whose address is specified as an argument to the command (this address
  can be the value of a physical address, a symbol or the address of a
  symbol). It can take as arguments (preceded by :code:`/`): the format
  to display the data in (:code:`x` for hexadecimal, :code:`d` for
  decimal, etc.), how many memory units to display and the size of a
  memory unit.

- :command:`disassemble` - Used to disassemble a function.

- :command:`p` (print) - Used to evaluate and show the value of an
  expression. The format to show the data in can be specified as
  an argument (:code:`/x` for hexadecimal, :code:`/d` for decimal, etc.).

The analysis of the kernel image is a method of static analysis. If we
want to perform dynamic analysis (analyzing how the kernel runs, not
only its static image) we can use :file:`/proc/kcore`; this is a dynamic
image (in memory) of the kernel.

.. code-block:: bash

    student@eg106$ gdb ~/src/linux/vmlinux /proc/kcore
    Core was generated by `root=/dev/hda3 ro'.
    #0  0x00000000 in ?? ()
    (gdb) p sys_call_table
    $1 = -1072579496
    (gdb) p /x sys_call_table
    $2 = 0xc011bc58
    (gdb) p /x &sys_call_table
    $3 = 0xc02e535c
    (gdb) x/16 &sys_call_table
    0xc02e535c `<sys_call_table>`:    0xc011bc58      0xc011482a      0xc01013d3     0xc014363d
    0xc02e536c `<sys_call_table+16>`: 0xc014369f      0xc0142d4e      0xc0142de5     0xc011548b
    0xc02e537c `<sys_call_table+32>`: 0xc0142d7d      0xc01507a1      0xc015042c     0xc0101431
    0xc02e538c `<sys_call_table+48>`: 0xc014249e      0xc0115c6c      0xc014fee7     0xc0142725

Using the dynamic image of the kernel is useful for detecting `rootkits <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit>`__.

#### Getting a stack trace

Sometimes, you will want information about the trace the execution
reaches a certain point. You can determine this information using
:command:`cscope` or LXR, but some function are called from many
execution paths, which makes this method difficult.

In these situations, it is useful to get a stack trace, which can be
simply done using the function :code:`dump_stack()`.

### Documentation

Kernel development is a difficult process, compared to user space
programming. The API is different and the complexity of the subsystems
in kernel requires additional preparation. The associated documentation
is heterogeneous, sometimes requiring the inspection of multiple sources
to have a more complete understanding of a certain aspect.

The main advantages of the Linux kernel are the access to sources and
the open development system. Because of this, the Internet offers a
larger number of documentation for the kernel.

A few links related to the Linux kernel are shown bellow:

- `KernelNewbies <http://kernelnewbies.org>`__
- `KernelNewbies - Kernel Hacking <http://kernelnewbies.org/KernelHacking>`__
- `Kernel Analysis - HOWTO <http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/KernelAnalysis-HOWTO.html>`__
- `Linux Kernel Programming <http://web.archive.org/web/20090228191439/http://www.linuxhq.com/lkprogram.html>`__
- `Linux kernel - Wikibooks <http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linux_kernel>`__

The links are not comprehensive. Using  `The Internet <http://www.google.com>`__ and
`kernel source code <http://lxr.free-electrons.com/>`__ is essential.

### Exercises


#### Remarks

.. note::

  -  Usually, the steps used to develop a kernel module are the
     following:

     -  editing the module source code (on the physical machine);
     -  module compilation (on the physical machine);
     -  generation of the minimal image for the virtual machine;
        this image contains the kernel, your module, busybox and
        eventually test programs;
     -  starting the virtual machine using QEMU;
     -  running the tests in the virtual machine.

  -  When using cscope, use :file:`~/src/linux`.
     If there is no :file:`cscope.out` file, you can generate it using
     the command :command:`make ARCH=x86 cscope`.

  -  You can find more details about the virtual machine at
     :ref:`vm_link`.

.. important::
    Before solving an exercice, **carefully** read all its bullets.

#### 1. Booting the virtual machine


A summary of the virtual machine infrastructure:

-  :file:`~/src/linux` - Linux kernel sources, needed to
   compile modules. The directory contains the file :file:`cscope.out`,
   used for navigation in the source tree.

-  :file:`~/src/linux/tools/labs/qemu`- scripts and auxiliary
   files used to generate and run the QEMU VM.

To start the VM, run :command:`make boot` in the directory :file:`~/src/linux/tools/labs`:

.. code-block:: shell

    student@eg106:~$ cd ~/src/linux/tools/labs
    student@eg106:~/src/linux/tools/labs$ make boot

By default, you will not get a prompt or any graphical interface, but you can connect to
a console exposed by the virtual machine using :command:`minicom` or :command:`screen`.

.. code-block:: shell

    student@eg106:~/src/linux/tools/labs$ minicom -D serial.pts

    <press enter>

    qemux86 login:
    Poky (Yocto Project Reference Distro) 2.3 qemux86 /dev/hvc0

Alternatively, you can start the virtual machine with graphical interface support, using
the :command:`QEMU_DISPLAY=sdl make boot`.

.. note::
    To access the virtual machine, at the login prompt, enter the
    username :code:`root`; there is no need to enter a password.
    The virtual machine will start with the permissions of the
    root account.

#### 2. Adding and using a virtual disk

.. note:: If you don't have the file :file:`mydisk.img`, you can download
          it from the address http://elf.cs.pub.ro/so2/res/laboratoare/mydisk.img.
          The file must be placed in :file:`tools/labs`.

In the :file:`~/src/linux/tools/labs` directory, you have a new virtual
machine disk, in the file :file:`mydisk.img`. We want to add the disk
to the virtual machine and use it within the virtual machine.

Edit :file:`qemu/Makefile` and add :code:`-drive file=mydisk.img,if=virtio,format=raw`
to the :code:`QEMU_OPTS` variable.

.. note:: There are already two disks added to qemu (disk1.img and disk2.img). You will need
          to add the new one after them. In this case, the new disk can be accessed as
          :file:`/dev/vdd` (vda is the root partition, vdb is disk1 and vdc is disk2).

.. hint:: You do not need to manually create the entry for the new disk in :file:`/dev`
          because the virtual machine uses :command:`devtmpfs`.

Run :code:`make` in :file:`tools/labs` to boot the virtual machine.
Create :file:`/test` directory and try to mount the new disk:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir /test
    mount /dev/vdd /test

The reason why we can not mount the virtual disk is because we do not have support in the
kernel for the filesystem with which the :file:`mydisk.img` is formatted. You will need
to identify the filesystem for :file:`mydisk.img` and compile kernel support for that filesystem.

Close the virtual machine (close the QEMU window, you do not need to use another command).
Use the :command:`file` command on the physical machine to find out with which filesystem
the :file:`mydisk.img` file is formatted. You will identify the :command:`btrfs` file system.

You will need to enable :command:`btrfs` support in the kernel and recompile the kernel image.

.. warning:: If you receive an error while executing the :command:`make menuconfig`
             command, you probably do not have the :command:`libncurses5-dev`
             package installed. Install it using the command:

             ::

                 sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev

.. hint:: Enter the :file:`~/src/linux/` subdirectory. Run :command:`make menuconfig`
          and go to the *File systems* section. Enable *Btrfs filesystem support*.
          You will need to use the builtin option (not the module), i.e. :command:`<*>` must appear
          next to the option (**not** :command:`<M>`).

          Save the configuration you have made. Use the default configuration file (:file:`config`).

          In the kernel source subdirectory (:file:`~/src/linux/`) recompile using the command:

          ::

              make

          To wait less, you can use the :command:`-j` option run multiple jobs in parallel.
          Generally, it is recommended to use :command:`number of CPUs+1`:

          ::

              make -j5

After the kernel recompilation finishes, **restart** the QEMU virtual machine:
that is, launch the :command:`make` command in the  subdirectory. You
do not need to copy anything, because the :file:`bzImage` file is a symlink to the kernel
image you just recompiled.

Inside the QEMU virtual machine, repeat the :command:`mkdir` and :command:`mount` operations.
With support for the :command:`btrfs` filesystem, now :command:`mount` will finish successfully.

.. note:: When doing your homework, there is no need to recompile the kernel
          because you will only use kernel modules. However, it is important
          to be familiar with configuring and recompiling a kernel.

          If you still plan to recompile the kernel, make a backup of the bzImage
          file (follow the link in ~/src/linux for the full path). This will allow
          you to return to the initial setup in order to have an environment
          identical to the one used by vmchecker.

#### 3. GDB and QEMU

We can investigate and troubleshoot the QEMU virtual machine in real time.

.. note:: You can also use the :command:`GDB Dashboard` plugin for a user-friendly interface.
          :command:`gdb` must be compiled with Python support.

          In order to install it, you can just run:
          ::

              wget -P ~ git.io/.gdbinit

To do this, we start the QEMU virtual machine first. Then, we can connect
with :command:`gdb` to **a running QEMU virtual machine** using the command

::

    make gdb

We used the QEMU command with the :command:`-s` parameter, which means
listening to port :code:`1234` from :command:`gdb`. We can do debugging
using a **remote target** for :command:`gdb`. The existing :file:`Makefile`
takes care of the details.

When you attach a debugger to a process, the process is suspended.
You can add breakpoints and inspect the current status of the process.

Attach to the QEMU virtual machine (using the :command:`make gdb` command)
and place a breakpoint in the :code:`sys_access` function using the
following command in the :command:`gdb` console:

::

    break sys_access

At this time, the virtual machine is suspended. To continue executing it (up to the possible call
of the :code:`sys_access` function), use the command:

::

    continue

in the :command:`gdb` console.

At this time, the virtual machine is active and has a usable console.
To make a :code:`sys_access` call, issue a :command:`ls` command.
Note that the virtual machine was again suspended by :command:`gdb`
and the corresponding :code:`sys_access` callback message appeared within the :command:`gdb` console.

Trace code execution using :command:`step` instruction, :command:`continue` or :command:`next`
instruction. You probably do not understand everything that happens, so use commands
such as :command:`list` and :command:`backtrace` to trace the execution.

.. hint:: At the :command:`gdb` prompt, you can press :command:`Enter`
          (without anything else) to rerun the last command.

#### 4. GDB spelunking

Use :command:`gdb` to display the source code of the function that creates kernel threads
(:code:`kernel_thread`).

.. note:: You can use GDB for static kernel analysis using, in the kernel source directory,
          a command such as:

          ::

              gdb vmlinux

          Go over the `gdb (Linux) <#gdb-linux>`__ section of the lab.

Use :command:`gdb` to find the address of the :code:`jiffies` variable in memory and its contents.
The :code:`jiffies` variable holds the number of ticks (clock beats) since the system started.

.. hint:: To track the value of the jiffies variable, use dynamic analysis in :command:`gdb`
          by running the command:

          ::

              make gdb

          as in the previous exercise.

          Go over the `gdb (Linux) <#gdb-linux>`__ section of the lab.

.. hint:: The :code:`jiffies` is a 64-bit variable.
          You can see that its address is the same as the :code:`jiffies_64` variable.

          To explore the contents of a 64-bit variable, use in the :command:`gdb` console the command:

          ::

              x/gx & jiffies

          If you wanted to display the contents of the 32-bit variable,
          you would use in the :command:`gdb` console the command:

          ::

              x/wx & jiffies

#### 5. Cscope spelunking


Use LXR or cscope in the :file:`~/src/linux/` directory to discover
the location of certain structures or functions.

Cscope index files are already generated. Use :command:`vim` and other related commands
to scroll through the source code. For example, use the command:

::

    vim

for opening the :command:`vim` editor. Afterwards, inside the editor, use commands such as:

:command:`:cs find g task\_struct`.

Find the file in which the following data types are defined:

-    ``struct task_struct``

-    ``struct semaphore``

-    ``struct list_head``

-    ``spinlock_t``

-    ``struct file_system_type``

.. hint:: For a certain structure, only its name needs to be searched.

          For instance, in the case of :command:`struct task_struct`,
          search for the :command:`task_struct` string.

Usually, you will get more matches. To locate the one you are interested in, do the following:

#.    List all matches by using, in :command:`vim`, :command:`:copen` command.

#.    Look for the right match (where the structure is defined) by looking for an open character
      (:command:`{`), a single character on the structure definition line. To search for the open
      braid you use in :command:`vim` the construction :command:`/{`.

#.    On the respective line, press :command:`Enter` to get into the source code where the variable
      is defined.

#.    Close the secondary window using the command: :command:`:cclose` command.

Find the file in which the following global kernel variables are declared:

-    ``sys_call_table``

-    ``file_systems``

-    ``current``

-    ``chrdevs``

.. hint:: To do this, use a :command:`vim` command with the syntax:

          :command:`:cs f g <symbol>`

          where :command:`<symbol>` is the name of the symbol being searched.

Find the file in which the following functions are declared:

-    ``copy_from_user``

-    ``vmalloc``

-    ``schedule_timeout``

-    ``add_timer``

.. hint:: To do this, use a :command:`vim` command with the syntax:

          :command:`:cs f g <symbol>`

          where :command:`<symbol>` is the name of the symbol being searched.

Scroll through the following sequence of structures:

-   ``struct task_struct``

-   ``struct mm_struct``

-   ``struct vm_area_struct``

-   ``struct vm_operations_struct``

That is, you access a structure and then you find fields with the data type of the
next structure, access the respective fields and so on.
Note in which files these structures are defined; this will be useful to the following labs.


.. hint:: In order to search for a symbol in :command:`vim` (with :command:`cscope` support)
          when the cursor is placed on it, use the :command:`Ctrl+]` keyboard shortcut.

          To return to the previous match (the one before search/jump), use the
          :command:`Ctrl+o` keyboard shortcut.

          To move forward with the search (to return to matches before :command:`Ctrl+o`),
          use the :command:`Ctrl+i` keyboard shortcut.

Following the above instructions, find and go through the function call sequence:

-   ``bio_alloc``

-   ``bio_alloc_bioset``

-   ``bvec_alloc``

-   ``kmem_cache_alloc``

-   ``slab_alloc``

.. note:: Read `cscope <#cscope>`__ or `LXR Cross-Reference <#lxr-cross-reference>`__ sections of the lab.
